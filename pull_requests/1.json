{"title":"feat: add auth and upgrade pages (signup, signin, forgot password, upgrade, what-you-get)","body":"Adds standalone pages and a small Nav component to replace prompt-based flows. Files: components/Nav.js, pages/signup.js, pages/signin.js, pages/forgot-password.js, pages/upgrade.js, pages/what-you-get.js. These pages use existing API endpoints under pages/api/* and provide clearer client UX. Non-breaking UI addition."}
